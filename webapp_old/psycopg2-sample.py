    psycopg2-sample.py
    Jeff Ondich, 23 April 2016

    A very short demo of how to use psycopg2 to connect to and
    query a PostgreSQL database. This demo assumes a "books"
    database like the one I've used in CS257 Spring 2016, including
    an authors table with fields (id, first_name, last_name,...).

    You might also want to consult the official psycopg2 tutorial
    at https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Psycopg2_Tutorial.

import psycopg2

# Storing your user name and password directly in your code
# is easiest:
#
#   database = 'yourdatabasename'
#   user = 'yourusername'
#   password = 'yourdatabasepassword'
#
# However, this introduces potential security problems, which we'll
# discuss in class. One common mitigation of these dangers is to put
# the data in a separate module that's in the Python import path,
# but not in the web server's file tree.
from config import password
from config import database
from config import user

names = ["pl_id", "pl_host_star_id", "pl_name", "pl_discmethod_id", "pl_orbper",
         "pl_orbsmax", "pl_orbeccen", "pl_massj", "pl_bmassprov", "pl_radj",
         "pl_dens", "pl_ttvflag", "pl_kepflag", "pl_k2flag", "pl_nnotes",
         "row_update", "pl_facility_id"]

# Connect to the database
try:
    connection = psycopg2.connect(database=database, user=user, password=password)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    exit()

# Query the database, leaving you with a "cursor"--an object you can
# use to iterate over the rows generated by your query.
try:
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    query = 'SELECT * FROM planets'
    cursor.execute(query)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    exit()

# We have a cursor now. Iterate over its rows to print the results.
print('===== All authors =====')
for row in cursor:
    dict = {}
    for i in range (0, len(row)):
        dict.update({names[i] : row[i]})
print()


print(cursor)




# # Do you have parameters to put into your query? To avoid
# # the very common and very dangerous security attack known
# # as "SQL Injection", use the parameterized version of
# # cursor.execute, like so.
# search_string = 'BrontÃ«'
# query = '''SELECT first_name, last_name
#            FROM authors
#            WHERE last_name = %s'''
# try:
#     cursor.execute(query, (search_string,))
# except Exception as e:
#     print(e)
#     exit()
#
# print('===== Authors with last name {0} ====='.format(search_string))
# for row in cursor:
#     print(row[0], row[1])
# print()

# Don't forget to close the database connection.
connection.close()
